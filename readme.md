# Welcome to my Coding Explorations!

Welcome to my collection of coding experiments, projects, and technical explorations. This repository serves as a showcase of my journey through different technologies, programming concepts, and creative solutions to interesting problems.

Each project here represents a learning opportunity, a technical challenge, or simply an idea I wanted to bring to life. Feel free to explore, learn from, or build upon anything you find useful.

### 1. [THE BIRDY GAME](https://ajdesignb.github.io/AJ-Github/TheBirdyProject/index.html)

## About the Game
An exploration of randomness through interactive gameplay—my own somewhat broken version of Flappy Bird.

This project examines how randomness shapes user experience through unpredictable obstacles, varying difficulties, and emergent gameplay moments. Built as an interactive randomizer, the game transforms chaos and uncertainty into a minute-long challenge where player input meets algorithmic unpredictability.

The experience features randomized pipe heights, spacing, and timing that create unique sessions with each playthrough. Through deliberate design choices in mapping, feedback, signifiers, and affordances, the game explores the tension between player control and system-generated chaos.

**Note:** This is one of my early explorations in interactive design and game development. As I'm still learning, this version intentionally retains its quirks and "broken" elements as part of the creative process.

### 2. [CHARACTER RANDOMISER](https://ajdesignb.github.io/MM621_F25/Assignments/attempt%202/index.html)

## About the Project

An interactive application that generates randomized character expressions at the press of a button.

This project explores the creative potential of randomness in visual design, utilizing the `random()` function, arrays, and for loops to create dynamic, ever-changing character states. Each button press triggers a new combination of facial features and expressions, demonstrating how algorithmic randomness can produce unexpected and engaging visual outcomes.

Built as an exercise in combining graphics with interactive functionality, the randomizer showcases how simple user input can unlock endless variations, transforming a static character into a living, evolving creation with each interaction.

### 3. [Mini Data Viz](https://ajdesignb.github.io/MM621_F25/Mini_DataViz_Assingment/index.html) using Pantry Data & CSV Files
**[Link to my code](https://github.com/AJdesignb/MM621_F25/tree/main/Mini_DataViz_Assingment)**

A hands-on dive into data visualization using real-world pantry food items and their nutritional information.

For this project, I collected nutritional data from at least 5 food items, organized it into a Google Sheets table, and loaded it as a CSV file into P5.js. The challenge was to create a visualization that goes beyond basic bar graphs—something that makes the data immediately understandable while being visually distinct and engaging.

This exploration taught me how to work with CSV data formats, parse nutritional information programmatically, and translate raw numbers into meaningful visual representations. Whether through custom graphics, creative orientations, or interactive elements that let users cycle through the data, the goal was to make complex nutritional information accessible at a glance.

A stepping stone toward more complex data visualization projects, this mini-project helped solidify my understanding of how data, design, and code intersect to tell compelling stories.

### 4. My very own PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

My very own corner of the internet, coded entirely with JavaScript (the basics!), HTML, and CSS!

This is basically me throwing everything I've learned about web development into one place and seeing what sticks. It's a wild mix of interactive elements, carefully crafted layouts, and styling choices that represent countless hours of trial, error, and those glorious "aha!" moments when the code finally works.

From making buttons do things with JavaScript to wrestling CSS into submission for responsive designs, this website is my digital playground and proof that I'm figuring this whole web development thing out, one line of code at a time. Like any good project, it's a forever work in progress—always evolving as I learn new things.
